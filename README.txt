Progress Bar for console applications
--------------------------------------
A simple, somewhat customisable progress bar for Python applications.

Designed to work on a basic Windows terminal. This means there is no assumptions that the user is using a fancier
UNIX terminal with more inbuilt support for fancy symbols and colours.

The progress bar is designed to 'mute' and log messages while it is operational, and then print them to the screen
after the progress bar has completed. It is also designed to be somewhat, but not overly customisable, to give the
user some contol over how it looks.
